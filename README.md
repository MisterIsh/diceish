# Dice-Ish

### A diceroller for real people
For this project my goal was to learn about the basics and not so basics of the framework Vue.Js, how to use version control, (via Git), and how to build a progressive web app(PWA).

### So, why make a diceroller like everyone else has?
I legitimately use dice rollers on a regular basis, and have never been as happy with their basic functionalities. So to provide a better experience I use stateful management. 

Why stateful management?
With stateful management I can set a 'source of truth', where information is interpreted before going to the user allowing the development to be easily expanded for different sets of needs.

### From here then?
Right now this is a minimum viable product, planned added features include dicerollers specific for different tabletop role playing games, more ways of interpreting the results, and authentication to log previous results and pre make what rolls you'll want/need for quick usage.
